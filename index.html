				<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Vince. Nice to meet you.</h1>
				<p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design.</p>

				<h2>What I can do for you?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Design.</h3>
						<p>I believe it is important to understand both design and development to achieve a successful user-facing product. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Prototyping.</h3>
						<p>Prototypes are a hybrid of design and interaction that enable a team to experience how a user interface will feel before it is coded.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Front-end.</h3>
						<p>I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross browser compatible, and performant.</p>
					</li>
